		<title>Pill Packaging Machine - Bill Sun</title>

		<h1>Autonomous Pill Packaging Machine</h1>
		<h3>AER201 - Engineering Design, University of Toronto</h3>
		<h4>Instructor: Prof. M. Reza Emami</h4>

		<p><a href="http://aer201.aerospace.utoronto.ca/course/syllabus.htm">Course Website</a></p>

		<p>AER201 is an multidisciplinary engineering design course that involves the design and construction of an
			autonomous robot, in teams of 3. My team had to build an autonomous pill packaging machine, where the user
			inserts a prescription organizer box and 3 different types of pills, and the machine organizes the pills
			into the pillbox based on given instructions. The instructions are loaded through a user interface on the
			machine. The requirements for the machine are outlined in the <a href="/assets/docs/RFP - Pill Boxing.pdf">Request
				for Proposal (RFP)</a>.</p>

		<p>Based on the requirements from the RFP, my team developed a potential design using the engineering design
			process, outlined by the <a href="/assets/docs/Team 7 Proposal.pdf">Proposal Document</a>.</p>

		<p>As a part of the role division of team members, I am mainly responsible for the elctromechanical subsystem of
			the machine. This includes all the structural, mechanical, and some electrical parts of the robot. It
			comprises the selection and powering of actuators (motors) and material selection. In addition, I am also
			involved in the circuits construction and programming of the microcontroller that controls all the
			functionalities.</p>

		<p>The <a href="/assets/docs/Final Report.pdf">Final Report</a> describes all the design decisions, construction and
			integration process, and testing procedures. All the code and datasheets are also on this document. The
			final product is currently partially functional. </p>
