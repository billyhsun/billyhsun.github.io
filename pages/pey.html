        <h1>PEY Co-op Summary</h1>
        <h3><a href="https://nuralogix.ai">Nuralogix Corporation</a></h3>
        <h3>Data Science Software Developer</h3>
        <h3>May 2019 — August 2020</h3>
        <br>

        <p>As a Data Science Software Developer, I was involved in both development and research work, 
            working with different teams in an Agile manner. I was mostly tasked with developing internal 
            software to accelerate data collection and processing, testing and implementing machine learning 
            models, and software testing. I was occasionally tasked with training machine learning models as well.</p>

        <li>Developed an end-to-end web application for testing survey-based machine learning models.</li>
        <li>Developed a symptoms-based COVID-19 assessment tool, based on a machine learning
        prediction model. Co-authored a research paper about this subject.</li>
        <li>Trained and implemented other questionnaire-based machine learning models to predict
        various mental health conditions and body parameters in children and adults.</li>
        <li>Co-lead the project to implement the system as a feature on the Anura app.</li>
        <li>Developed an API interface to simplify access to the DeepAffex cloud engine. Wrote an
        open-source demo program using the above to showcase the software development cases.</li>
        <li>Developed a GUI application and pipeline to automate data uploading and processing.</li>
        <li>Developed a web app for video processing and testing new video algorithms.</li>
        <li>Assisted in testing of the Anura app and other public applications.</li>
        <li>Helped develop several other internal tools to improve efficiency.</li>
        
        <p>Nuralogix is a start-up founded in Toronto in 2015 with the purpose of changing the landscape of
        personal health monitoring. It is based on research that utilizes computer vision and machine
        learning techniques to predict various health parameters (such as heart rate, breathing patterns,
        and blood pressure) from a video of a person’s face. This enables health monitoring with merely
        a smartphone or a camera, without any specialized devices. The company has developed
        cloud and mobile platforms, including the Anura app and the DeepAffex cloud service, to turn
        theory into practice. Nuralogix has been rapidly growing its company and customer base.
        I had a wonderful experience working here for my PEY term. Being a part of the Data Team, I
        participated in multiple unique projects throughout the company, working with teams coming
        from interdisciplinary backgrounds. These projects encompassed many technical areas, ranging
        from software testing to data gathering and processing to full-stack software development and
        machine learning. From completing these projects, I gained various technical and non-technical
        skills that would significantly help me in a high-technology workplace. As a student coming
        from a machine intelligence background, this PEY term really opened my eyes to the industry of
        applied data science and machine learning, and kickstarted my career in machine learning and
        artificial intelligence. Being in a workplace also taught me a lot about self-awareness and
        professionalism as an engineer that I would not have learned in school. Furthermore, being in a
        start-up environment also gave me valuable lessons about entrepreneurship and decision-making
        at a corporate level, as it gave me the opportunity to observe and experience everything up-close.</p>
